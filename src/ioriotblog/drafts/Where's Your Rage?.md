What happened to the internet?

I ask these questions of myself and the rest of the internet. It was a slow process, but inch by inch we've decided to just accept every digital (microaggression?) and trudge ever onward, happy in our complacency as long as we were still receiving the goods and services we loved.

I am pissed. Royally pissed.

The internet is getting worse all the time. Day by day, update by update, the good parts of our online communities and services are being undermined on the altar of a few more clicks and a handful of dollars.

- Prediction markets
- Shitty software getting worse by the day, kicking and screaming to wrench every last penny (nickel) out of your pockets
- Egotistical tech billionaires surrounded by yes-men and women who think they alone know what everyone wants and needs
- A corporate ecosystem demanding constant, unending growth at all costs that is buoyed by all the workers whose paychecks depend on keeping their graphs going up and to the right no matter what
- Tax software whose unnecessary existence is eternally prolonged by corporate lobbyists whose sole purpose is to ensure any attempt at providing simple and effective tax software is strangled in the crib
- Social media being social media
- The tech industry's obsession with the next big thing maintaining a cyclical hype cycle of investment and VC culture
	- This obsession used to be a good thing, spurring growth and innovation
- Streaming and digital goods taking away our ownership in exchange for monthly subscriptions that cost more every year for even less (Adobe, Netflix, etc.)

How can we fix all this?
- Open Source Alternatives
- Companies (probably private) that don't follow the enshittification path
- Pushing back against shitty corporate tactics
	- How?
- Putting up with less shit
- Unionization
