		IO Riot is dedicated to exploring the ripples caused by technological change in our world and throwing off the rosy perspective that has pervaded tech journalism & criticism in the past. Ignoring the potential impact or unintended consequences (wink wink) of new technologies does a disservice to both our communities and the same companies trying to create change through their work.
	</p>

	<p>
		These technologies being released have the potential to drastically upend daily life, so the need for thorough criticism and introspection has never been more important. We want to move past the shallow “look at this shiny new thing” narrative encouraged by the Silicon Valleys of the world and focus on the heart of what these things, whatever they are, mean for all of us. The good and the bad, direct and indirect, intentional and unintentional, sprawling and focused. And technologies from the past, the present, and the future as best as we can tell. We’ll be examining both the physical and the digital, but the focus will always start and end with technology.
