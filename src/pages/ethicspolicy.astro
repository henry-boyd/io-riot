		An ethics policy isn't something you see often on an independent/hacked together publication or whatever you want to call this website. But I think it's worth having, even if it sometimes makes things a little trickier for one random guy on the internet. Especially while living through such trying times, where we repeatedly see ethics take a backseat (if it's given any consideration at all) to the pursuit of profit, power, and maintaining the status quo. It takes time and effort to maintain a professional standard, but is well worth the reward of ensuring the independence and integrity of this publication while maintaining the trust of our audience.

	<p>
		In some aspects maintaining an ethical standard can be even more difficult for a one-man band like myself. I'm more prone to bias without colleagues to offer a countering opinion or debate potential conflicts with. And the fact of the matter is that I do work in this industry and plan to be for a very long time, so all of my writing will hold opinions that are formed by my background and life experiences. But no matter what, I promise I will do everything I can to be aware of my own biases and ensure that they do not interfere with this publication's mission.

		I also want to give shoutouts to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ethics-statement">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.platformer.news/ethics/">Platformer</a>, whose ethics policies heavily influenced this one. We're all better off when we support news platforms that believe in editorial independence and hold themselves, along with the industry, to a higher standard.
