-Listen to Decoder episode with Robinhood CEO again, prediction markets vs. gambling ("Incentive to change the outcome by having a financial stake in it)

-Prediction markets are the economy of convenience applied to the American Dream (everyone wants everything faster/has been taught to think that way by technology?)

Poly market article start off talking about how everybody when they learn about the Oracle of Delphi. It's this mystical magical supernatural thing, but the reality was there was a lot of politics and intrigue and calculations involved in it. Of you know not mystical but just ethereal kind of can't really shape it sort of process but in the reality there is a lot of calculation and opinion behind it and also the possibility of bad actors.  
  
Our prediction markets becoming more popular because like online gambling people have lost faith in the idea of the American dream and that there's a pathway to get ahead. If you work hard enough, instead, now they think it's all chance and there's really no other way to make it unless you win big. Also, maybe just is a reflection of people's loss of faith in order and embrace of. I don't know chaos or something like that. Anarchy in the modern world.
