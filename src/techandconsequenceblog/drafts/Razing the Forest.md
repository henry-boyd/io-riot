I didn't grow up watching Studio Ghibli, but after watching *Princess Mononoke* in college it easily became one of my favorite movies. Beyond its gorgeous animation typical of Studio Ghibli films, I was struck by the storytelling and how realistic each character's motivations were. I just couldn't remember the last time I'd seen something that did such an amazing job showing people in shades of grey like that.
