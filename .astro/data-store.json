Consumers are presented with more than a few streaming services and video on demand apps that offer thousands of titles, more than one person could ever hope to watch in a lifetime. But recently a new player has entered the scene that offers a smaller catalog of content that is surprisingly refreshing.\n\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/A24VOD//Pasted image 20240929191010.png\">\u003C/div>\n\nAngst & Existential Crises Everywhere All at Once\n\nA24, the independent film studio darling, recently launched its own member service named [AAA24](https://aaa24.a24films.com/). For $5 a month you get access to exclusive behind-the-scenes content as well as discounted merch and early access events. But part of that launch also included the release of a standalone [video on demand service](https://app.a24films.com/tabs/home), currently available as a web app and an iOS app. While the service's functionality and services are pretty standard fare that you will see with most other video on demand providers or streaming services, one notable difference is the catalog size.\n\nAs of December 2023 A24 has 87 films available to rent or buy through the service, most of their catalog besides a few more recent releases. Compare that to Netflix's 18,000+ titles, Hulu's 7,250+ titles, or Max's (formerly known as HBO Max) 3,300+ titles and you might find yourself wondering why anyone would even bother signing up or using the service. Not only that, but many of these same titles are also available to stream on Max and [will be for the foreseeable future](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/hbo-max-a24-deal-1235712928/).\n\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/A24VOD/Pasted image 20240929191100.png\">\u003C/div>\n\nI'm panicking just looking at these.\n\nBut while using the A24 app I didn't notice any trace of choice paralysis thanks to this smaller catalog. Instead of spending altogether too much time comparing my choices and eventually falling down a bottomless hole of options before giving up and picking whatever I found, I was able to see the entire library in the span of a few minutes. I was a few minutes deep into my moody and colorful exploration of the human condition (Aftersun in this case, just brutally brilliant) by the time I normally would have been only starting to panic on any other platform.\n\nWhile A24 won't be dethroning Netflix anytime soon, it's releasing this standalone service at an opportune moment. Right now consumers have a lot of reasons to be fed up with the larger platforms: [ongoing price increases](https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max), password-sharing crackdowns, overall [poor user experiences on their platforms](https://www.theverge.com/23274393/amazon-prime-video-netflix-hbo-apps-look-the-same), and the constant rigamarole of content being cancelled or removed entirely from libraries. These issues have many wondering if the streaming model itself is [fundamentally broken](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/01/is-streaming-broken). Plus as a film studio A24 isn't beholden to this service in order to survive and it doesn't have to grapple with the cutthroat nature of streaming prices since they are only offering their content on demand. Add to that A24's sizable community of devoted fans as well as its hyper-unique branding and the chance of success is looking good.\n\nBut there are also a few industry trends working against a standalone service like this. For one thing, the last thing people want to do right now is sign up for one more service. [Subscription fatigue](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/with-subscription-fatigue-setting-in-companies-need-to-think-hard-about-fees) is all around us as every manner of company, whether it's appropriate or not, looks into moving to a subscription model to obtain reoccurring revenue from customers. Even though the paid membership isn't required for access to A24's titles, that still means one more account you have to create and maintain. And while there have been other attempts in the past to create video on demand services centered around specific themes or genres, the results have been mixed. AMC Networks' [Shudder became a breakaway streaming hit](https://deadline.com/2023/10/amc-shudder-horror-streaming-service-success-2-1235589014/) for horror fans and has exploded in size since its launch in 2015, while The Criterion Channel's niche classic movie service [Filmstruck](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/filmstruck-shutdown-warnermedia-turner-1202998364/) fizzled out a mere two years after its launch in 2016. Another interesting note is that Shudder's catalog has a little over 700 titles compared to Filmstruck's over 1,600 titles while it was active. So it's hard to say whether or not these factors will have enough of an impact on the A24 app.\n\nNow I don't believe A24 is trying to compete with any streaming services at the level of a Netflix or Amazon, but I do believe the company is picking up on the trend towards independent platforms we are seeing play out in many other content-focused industries. And while we've seen plenty of individual creators in fields such as video content and journalism thrive using this business model I don't expect there will be more film and television companies following in A24's footsteps anytime soon. Mainly because there really isn't any other independent film company that can wield the same level of cultural capital. A24 has nurtured a devoted following by curating a distinct brand of films that permeates across genres and themes in a way no other independent film studio has managed to replicate so far. If I say the name A24 to the average moviegoer, there's a decent chance that a specific film or vibe will probably pop into their mind almost immediately. But outside of giants like Marvel/DC/Disney/etc. I can't name a single other studio who has the same level of prestige. There just aren't any other studios or bodies of work as opinionated or cohesive enough to stand out to consumers in contrast to the amorphous and all-consuming platforms that dominate the industry.\n\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/A24VOD/Pasted image 20240929191114.png\">\u003C/div>\n\nThe A24 app isn't going to trigger major changes across video on demand. It will likely remain a niche service used by a very specific group of consumers devoted to one film studio's work. But in an industry dominated by streaming behemoths, I think an option on the opposite end of that spectrum is a welcome addition. And while I don't envision any other studios joining A24 anytime soon, I believe having more specific and curated VOD options like these will only serve to improve our content consumption as consumers. It's an opportunity for all of us to try swapping out a tsunami of endless content for a pond. Limitations to be certain, but perhaps a little more serene.","src/content/blog/A24vod.md","682025afb6228ab9",{"html":148,"metadata":149},"\u003Cp>The first time I remember having too many movie choices was when our local movie rental store (RIP Media Wave) decided to transition to DVDs and offload all of their VHS tapes.

For one thing, the last thing people want to do right now is sign up for one more service. \u003Ca href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/with-subscription-fatigue-setting-in-companies-need-to-think-hard-about-fees\">Subscription fatigue\u003C/a> is all around us as every manner of company, whether it’s appropriate or not, looks into moving to a subscription model to obtain reoccurring revenue from customers. Even though the paid membership isn’t required for access to A24’s titles, that still means one more account you have to create and maintain. And while there have been other attempts in the past to create video on demand services centered around specific themes or genres, the results have been mixed. AMC Networks’ \u003Ca href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/10/amc-shudder-horror-streaming-service-success-2-1235589014/\">Shudder became a breakaway streaming hit\u003C/a> for horror fans and has exploded in size since its launch in 2015, while The Criterion Channel’s niche classic movie service \u003Ca href=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/filmstruck-shutdown-warnermedia-turner-1202998364/\">Filmstruck\u003C/a> fizzled out a mere two years after its launch in 2016. Another interesting note is that Shudder’s catalog has a little over 700 titles compared to Filmstruck’s over 1,600 titles while it was active. So it’s hard to say whether or not these factors will have enough of an impact on the A24 app.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now I don’t believe A24 is trying to compete with any streaming services at the level of a Netflix or Amazon, but I do believe the company is picking up on the trend towards independent platforms we are seeing play out in many other content-focused industries. And while we’ve seen plenty of individual creators in fields such as video content and journalism thrive using this business model I don’t expect there will be more film and television companies following in A24’s footsteps anytime soon. Mainly because there really isn’t any other independent film company that can wield the same level of cultural capital. A24 has nurtured a devoted following by curating a distinct brand of films that permeates across genres and themes in a way no other independent film studio has managed to replicate so far. If I say the name A24 to the average moviegoer, there’s a decent chance that a specific film or vibe will probably pop into their mind almost immediately. But outside of giants like Marvel/DC/Disney/etc. I can’t name a single other studio who has the same level of prestige. There just aren’t any other studios or bodies of work as opinionated or cohesive enough to stand out to consumers in contrast to the amorphous and all-consuming platforms that dominate the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/A24VOD/Pasted image 20240929191114.png\">\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>The A24 app isn’t going to trigger major changes across video on demand. It will likely remain a niche service used by a very specific group of consumers devoted to one film studio’s work. But in an industry dominated by streaming behemoths, I think an option on the opposite end of that spectrum is a welcome addition. And while I don’t envision any other studios joining A24 anytime soon, I believe having more specific and curated VOD options like these will only serve to improve our content consumption as consumers. It’s an opportunity for all of us to try swapping out a tsunami of endless content for a pond. Limitations to be certain, but perhaps a little more serene.\u003C/p>",{"headings":150,"localImagePaths":151,"remoteImagePaths":152,"frontmatter":153,"imagePaths":156},[],[],[],{"title":137,"description":138,"pubDate":154,"heroImage":140,"tags":155},"Jul 08 2023",[142,143],[],"lousy-gadgets-are-shining-a-spotlight-on-ais-biggest-problem",{"id":157,"data":159,"body":166,"filePath":167,"digest":168,"rendered":169},{"title":160,"description":161,"pubDate":162,"heroImage":163,"tags":164},"Lousy Gadgets are Shining a Spotlight on AI's Biggest Problem","The harsh reality of standalone AI is a lot less glamorous than what tech companies have been promising",["Date","2024-05-05T06:00:00.000Z"],"/src/media/LousyAIGadgets/LousyAIGadgetsfeatured.png",[165],"gadgets","With the long-anticipated release of the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 the first wave of standalone AI gadgets have arrived in consumer's hands. And the response has been… overwhelming negative to say the least.\n\nThere are more than a few obvious reasons why these AI devices are being thoroughly panned by most reviewers. For starters, they are just plain bad. Both have had their fair shares of flaws right out of the gate: poor battery life, confusing if not completely ineffective interfaces, and perhaps most notable of all barely offering a fraction of the functionality that their companies have been proudly marketing in all the time leading up to these releases. Lately it seems overpromising and underdelivering has become the norm for far too many tech companies, Human and Rabbit Inc. chief among them.

We’ve seen this same release planning play out in gaming to disastrous effect, and like other reviewers I’ll echo the fact that no one should be paying for these devices in their current state. Both Rabbit and Humane made grandiose claims about what these devices could do and almost none of that capability currently exists in either device. And probably won’t exist for a very long time, if ever. Dangling features like these to entice consumers is at best an underhanded gimmick that creates distrust and also hinders any future attempts to create worthwhile products in this new category. While a vocal minority have stirred controversy by attacking tech reviewers for not giving these companies a chance to iterate and improve their products, those wounds are entirely self-inflicted by making promises that couldn’t be kept.\n\nMany reviewers tried their best to at least acknowledge the few bright spots of both devices. For the Human AI Pin this was the fact that the device was trying something daring by removing your phone from the picture entirely, even if that didn’t really work at all and only further highlighted the effectiveness of the modern smartphone. Meanwhile the Rabbit R1 was mainly applauded for being positioned as more of a novelty device than a serious tool thanks to its cheaper price and sleek Teenage Engineering-supplied aesthetic, not that two hundred dollars is inexpensive (and it still remains to be seen if the device will eventually start charging a subscription). But with very little else to find, most reviewers were forced to fall back on what’s essentially become a trope by now when discussing AI; mentioning the exciting hypothetical potential of gadgets like these in the future, but a future that is very far off from where they are now.\n\nBut I think the biggest reason that gadgets like these won’t be adopted anytime soon comes down to a fundamental flaw of current AI technology that has existed since it first exploded in popularity and becomes even more glaring in the context of standalone AI devices: the lack of reliability.\n\nWe've moved on from the “Hey look at this cool new thing!” era of initial AI discourse and into the “Look at how AI will help regular Joes!” stage. AI companies face rising costs, slowing growth, and massive skepticism need to sell these tools however they can to an increasingly wary public which is also concerned about potentially losing their jobs to these same tools. But the tired answer of “AI can help with _xyz_ but only sometimes and there’s a pretty good chance it will be factually inaccurate or just lie to you fairly frequently” just isn’t good enough for the average consumer. Both the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 reviews have made it abundantly clear that you shouldn’t rely on them for anything important. Hallucination is rampant, whether you are asking for the weather, the score from last night’s game, or a summary of how nuclear fission works. It’s the same roulette wheel of chance whether or not what you receive from the device is accurate or even addresses your current need.\n\nThere’s an implicit trust we have in the devices we use every day and that trust has to be earned. But I still don’t know anyone who puts faith in AI at that level, or even trusts it at all for that matter. If anything this lack of reliability creates a necessity for paranoia that most find uncomfortable if not time-consuming and energy-draining to the point of uselessness. The inherent skepticism we have with AI in its current state makes using them as standalone devices impossible for the same reason why you wouldn’t want to be friends with someone who lied to you every third sentence. A relationship like that means your guard always has to be up to some extent and that is exhausting. You wouldn’t keep a smartphone in your pocket everyday if a call failed every third try, and until that changes no one is likely to keep either the Humane AI Pin or the Rabbit R1 in their pocket (or on their shirt collar) either.\n\n\n\u003Ch3 style=\"text-align: center\">Featured Image Review Links:\u003C/h3>\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;\">\n\u003Cdiv>\n\n- **Humane AI Pin**\n    - [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html)\n    - [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA)\n    - [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/11/humane-ai-pin-review/)\n    - [Wired](https://www.wired.com/review/humane-ai-pin/)\n    - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review)\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\n\n- **Rabbit R1**\n    - [Mashable](https://mashable.com/review/rabbit-r1)\n    - [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc)\n    - [Tom’s Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/rabbit-r1-review)\n    - [Techradar](https://www.techradar.com/phones/i-spent-a-day-with-rabbit-r1-and-its-a-beautiful-mess-that-im-not-sure-anyone-needs)\n    - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147159/rabbit-r1-review-ai-gadget)\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>","src/content/blog/Lousy Gadgets are Shining a Spotlight on AI's Biggest Problem.md","e419e26c697e3f1d",{"html":170,"metadata":171},"\u003Cp>With the long-anticipated release of the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 the first wave of standalone AI gadgets have arrived in consumer’s hands.

Who knows, maybe one day soon I’ll have to stop buying quarters entirely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe class=\"embedded-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiK7s_0tGsg?si=TnZX6qZLWibIDUwy&#x26;start=550\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>ADDENDUM!!\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>\nNot too long after posting this I ended up listening to an episode of the Waveform podcast where Marques Brownlee interviewed Hasan Minhaj.

Not massively worse mind you, but enough to be noticeable here and there. A slightly downgraded experience affecting almost every corner of the internet.\n\nThis change became abundantly clear one day while scrolling through my TikTok feed. The app's massive push towards monetization has already turned most of my feed into a wasteland of QVC imitators, but amidst the depressing shopping livestreams and bizarre product placements I noticed a curious new trend; static images of Denzel Washington with motivational quotes narrated over the top.\n\nThe reason this caught my attention is because I'm already a big fan of Mr. Washington's work. I grew watching his films (_Fallen_ is a great movie and I will gladly die on that hill!) and I'm very familiar with the cadence of his voice and his more famous quotes. So it was immediately obvious to me that the audio of his voice was AI-generated and I was fairly certain Denzel Washington had never said this.\n\nThen not two videos later I was confronted with another, a different Denzel picture but the exact same quote and AI audio. Curious, but not exactly unique nowadays; I see plenty of repetitive videos on my Tiktok feed nowadays during what little time I spend on the app anymore. The repetition mostly comes from different accounts all trying to sell the same gadget desperately in search of a problem to solve. But lo and behold, not a few swipes later I was looking at another Denzel picture and the same motivational quote.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap\">\n\u003Cdiv>\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@g_s504/video/7354570923418062123\" data-video-id=\"7354570923418062123\" style=\"border-left: none; max-width: 325px;min-width: 325px;\" > \u003Csection> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"@g_s504\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@g_s504?refer=embed\">@g_s504\u003C/a> \u003Cp>\u003C/p> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - glenn\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7354571006251485994?refer=embed\">♬ original sound - glenn\u003C/a> \u003C/section> \u003C/blockquote> \u003Cscript async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@empowermind8/video/7357981816680172843\" data-video-id=\"7357981816680172843\" style=\"border-left: none; max-width: 325px;min-width: 325px;\" > \u003Csection> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"@empowermind8\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@empowermind8?refer=embed\">@empowermind8\u003C/a> Never Force anyone to stay with you #motivation\u003Ca title=\"denzelwashington\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/denzelwashington?refer=embed\">#denzelwashington\u003C/a>\u003Ca title=\"motivationalquotes\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/motivationalquotes?refer=embed\">#motivationalquotes\u003C/a> \u003Ca title=\"relationshipadvice\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationshipadvice?refer=embed\">#relationshipadvice\u003C/a> \u003Ca title=\"lifelessons\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lifelessons?refer=embed\">#lifelessons\u003C/a> \u003Ca title=\"lifechoices\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lifechoices?refer=embed\">#lifechoices\u003C/a> \u003Ca title=\"lifeadvicetiktok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lifeadvicetiktok?refer=embed\">#lifeadvicetiktok\u003C/a> \u003Ca title=\"staypositive\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/staypositive?refer=embed\">#staypositive\u003C/a> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound  - EmpowerMind\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-EmpowerMind-7357981902956956458?refer=embed\">♬ original sound  - EmpowerMind\u003C/a> \u003C/section> \u003C/blockquote> \u003Cscript async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sharaya_sharaya/video/7351134111504928032\" data-video-id=\"7354570923418062123\" style=\"border-left: none; max-width: 325px;min-width: 325px;\" > \u003Csection> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"@g_s504\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@g_s504?refer=embed\">@g_s504\u003C/a> \u003Cp>\u003C/p> \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - glenn\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7354571006251485994?refer=embed\">♬ original sound - glenn\u003C/a> \u003C/section> \u003C/blockquote> \u003Cscript async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\nThe quote itself seems to be a mashup of common tropes in motivational speeches:\n\n_\"If you're rejected, accept it. If you're unloved, let go. If they choose someone or something over you, move on. Not everyone you love will stay. Not everyone you trust will be loyal. I don't care about losing people who don't wanna be in my life anymore. I've lost people who meant the world to me and I'm still doing just fine. Do not follow the majority. Follow the right way. You can feel it when someone is not being real with you. Energy never lies. Always speak how you feel and never be sorry for being real. Give people time, give people space. Don't beg anyone to stay, let them roam. What's meant for you will always be yours. I feel so much better when people don't know where I am and what I'm doing. You may not be able to control every situation and its outcome but you can control your attitude and how you deal with it. Do good, it will come back to you in unexpected ways. Be happy with what you have while working for what you want. Remember that some things have to end for better things to begin.\"_\n\nIn all my internet sleuthing I didn't find any evidence Denzel Washington has ever spoken these words. In fact it looks like this quote has only existed for a few months based on the timestamps I saw while combing through TikTok videos. But I don't believe seeing all these videos at once are just mere algorithmic happenstance.\n\nBesides this Denzel deluge I've seen similar patterns everywhere in my corner of the internet: social media feeds for every app have slightly more low-quality sponsored content and advertisements to scroll past. Friend requests from spam accounts sending phishing links or pornography are increasing in frequency. Search engine results have a little bit more junk we need to wade through to find the answers we need than they used to. Even more isolated areas of content don't seem to be immune to this onslaught (just ask the scientific community about their recent [dubious research results](https://www.404media.co/google-says-it-discovered-millions-of-new-materials-with-ai-human-researchers/) or [peer reviews](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07183.pdf)). The junk and spam seeping into the internet is steadily increasing in velocity and volume and as a result I find myself spending more of my time filtering through meaningless and worthless pieces of content. Or put more simply, the internet is filling up with garbage. And more than usual.\n\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/The Great Internet Garbage Patch is Growing Larger Every Day/Ocean Garbage.png\">\u003C/img>\u003C/div>\n\nIt's like a For You page but with less reposts\n\nIt seems one of the more negative consequences of AI advances has finally started to rear its head. Easier access to this technology has allowed more people than ever to [start churning out low-quality content at an exponential pace](https://www.404media.co/inside-the-world-of-tiktok-spammers-and-the-ai-tools-that-enable-them/) in the never-ending pursuit of consumers, whether that's in the form of views, clicks, or likes, and the potential income that can come along with them. Not to mention the rampant disinformation and misinformation we're seeing from this content that plenty of social media users [aren't even noticing](https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-being-overrun-with-stolen-ai-generated-images-that-people-think-are-real/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter). And this is just the start, wait until AI-generated content has really whittled away at the foundations of [world history](https://marinaamaral.substack.com/p/ai-is-creating-fake-historical-photos) and other . Many publications have already written about how AI going mainstream would affect the fields of SEO and marketing, but it seems this change has finally started to impact the public-facing side of the internet as well. And the bad news is that it's only going to get worse from here.\n\nThe problem is there doesn't seem to be much anyone can or will do to head off the tidal wave of internet garbage headed our way. While AI-generated content is all the rage, tools to identify and filter this content has seen very little enthusiasm. AI detection tools have proven ineffective at best (and usually [worse](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/07/1075982/ai-text-detection-tools-are-really-easy-to-fool/) or [much worse](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/) than that), when they aren't [being taken out of use entirely](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807487/openai-ai-generated-low-accuracy), and that arms race will always be reacting to advances rather than proactively cleaning up. A few areas of the internet have seen successful attempts to detect and filter out AI-generated content, but only targeted very specific fields of content or use cases. Typically this has been accomplished by looking at the content against a threshold for what most likely constitutes AI patterns compared to the average person’s use of language. But this is while AI-generated content can still be laughably obvious in many cases. Will these detection tools be effective at all once it becomes almost impossible to tell the difference between content created by humans and AI through language patterns? And who is going to decide where to draw a line between these two? Language is a complex and ever-changing landscape, so adding to this complexity is that any tool created will need to be able to keep up with these changes. On top of that, who knows what kind of changes in syntax and dialect we’ll see as a result AI’s influence over the next few years?\n\nOn the opposite end of this conundrum, AI signatures are another tool being created to easily differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated content. Establishing standards to mark AI content at the source seems to be a more effective solution given the sheer volume of content being generated in so many different mediums and [efforts are already underway](https://c2pa.org/) with the support of some major players in technology. But the problem here lies in solidarity. There will always be companies refusing to opt in to standards because, either for technological or financial reasons, they can't or don't want to. And there will always be customers seeking these companies to get around those standards. And then we’re just back where we started trying to identify content generated by AI, though with at least a sizable amount of that work already done for us thanks to those standards.\n\nOf course another avenue that could offer relief from all this garbage would be through SEO changes. If search engines update their cryptic algorithms to favor human-generated content, or trusted sites that have shown reliability and authenticity, over AI-generated content in search results that would almost certainly provide a financial incentive for companies to clean things up. But in many cases these same tech companies that rule over SEO [don't have any incentive](https://www.404media.co/google-news-is-boosting-garbage-ai-generated-articles/) to clean up an internet that they themselves are already actively polluting with AI-generated junk. And if the history of SEO changes is any indication, this effort will devolve into an endless and forth between search engines making new rules and SEO experts finding new ways to work around those same rules.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the future of our internet? To put it simply, I think the average internet experience is going to keep seeing a steady downturn in quality until suddenly that trend accelerates and we find ourselves neck-deep in AI-generated junk. And I’m worried that like any boiling frog (not that this idiom is true at all) by the time any of us notice it will be too late to take effective action.\n\nMy fear is that two versions of the internet will emerge because of this influx of garbage. One will be a well-maintained walled garden, full of mostly pleasant actual human people and an overall enjoyable place to visit with a nice barrier keeping out most but probably not all of the junk. And the other will be a true internet hellscape: inundated with low-quality content, spewing endlessly repetitive knockoffs of original thoughts at you, [reduced to stereotypes](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/), with fake people hawking nonsense goods & services and constant waves of spam ads knocking you down with every click. And the the only factor separating the two will be price.\n\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/The Great Internet Garbage Patch is Growing Larger Every Day/Inequality Divide.png\">\u003C/img>\n  Meet your new internets! (Not to be on the nose or anything)\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\nContent moderation costs companies a lot of time, money, and headache depending on who finds themselves being moderated. Which is why recently we've seen some shy away from moderation in favor of a free-for-all moderation ecosystem (to dubious results I might add). But other companies are finding little alternative but to ramp up content moderation efforts leading to rising costs that cut into revenue. And these two approaches may create a digital rift between the haves and the have-nots. We’ve already seen this to some extent with the recent influx of ad-free vs. ad-supported streaming options (proving that cost is once again the ultimate deciding factor as we saw with the “free” ad-supported TV so many people signed onto). If that happens there’s going to be an economic separation of tech companies that take necessary steps to prevent this influx of low-quality AI content and the ones that don't. And my fear is that this will segregate the internet into two very distinct cultural experiences.\n\nThere isn’t a whole lot we as individual users can do to prevent this wave of garbage. I've seen some argue that the only way to effectively combat this invasion is through [government intervention and legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/opinion/ai-internet-x-youtube.html), which I agree would be a massive step in the right direction. But this AI-generated content isn’t going anymore and the tools to make it are only going to become more accessible with each passing day. Like any tech trend we’ve seen take off in the past the AI hype train has a lot of momentum, but I do think society has started to recognize enough of its inherent problems that enthusiasm has begun to dampen. Our only hope is that enough outcry, both from users and all the tech companies in this space who are going to take the brunt of the damage this influx of garbage will cause, forces AI companies to invest in effective tools to moderate and manage the flow of this mess they’ve created. But for now we will have to wade our way through this trickle of garbage and junk in the search for authentic Denzel Washington content. Just don’t be surprised when that trickle turns into something bigger.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\"embedded-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdT2ZATYuMQ?si=qZGaTDAppn_AOTfY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\nThere's a Denzel reference for every occasion, including a metaphor for the invasion of  \nAI-generated garbage content on the internet.","src/content/blog/The Great Internet Garbage Patch is Growing Larger Every Day.md","967c8b026a0a4ff2",{"html":213,"metadata":214},"\u003Cp>If you’re someone who regularly uses the internet in their day-to-day life you’ve probably noticed lately it feels… worse.

Many publications have already written about how AI going mainstream would affect the fields of SEO and marketing, but it seems this change has finally started to impact the public-facing side of the internet as well. And the bad news is that it’s only going to get worse from here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The problem is there doesn’t seem to be much anyone can or will do to head off the tidal wave of internet garbage headed our way. While AI-generated content is all the rage, tools to identify and filter this content has seen very little enthusiasm. AI detection tools have proven ineffective at best (and usually \u003Ca href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/07/1075982/ai-text-detection-tools-are-really-easy-to-fool/\">worse\u003C/a> or \u003Ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/\">much worse\u003C/a> than that), when they aren’t \u003Ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807487/openai-ai-generated-low-accuracy\">being taken out of use entirely\u003C/a>, and that arms race will always be reacting to advances rather than proactively cleaning up. A few areas of the internet have seen successful attempts to detect and filter out AI-generated content, but only targeted very specific fields of content or use cases. Typically this has been accomplished by looking at the content against a threshold for what most likely constitutes AI patterns compared to the average person’s use of language. But this is while AI-generated content can still be laughably obvious in many cases. Will these detection tools be effective at all once it becomes almost impossible to tell the difference between content created by humans and AI through language patterns? And who is going to decide where to draw a line between these two? Language is a complex and ever-changing landscape, so adding to this complexity is that any tool created will need to be able to keep up with these changes. On top of that, who knows what kind of changes in syntax and dialect we’ll see as a result AI’s influence over the next few years?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the opposite end of this conundrum, AI signatures are another tool being created to easily differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated content. Establishing standards to mark AI content at the source seems to be a more effective solution given the sheer volume of content being generated in so many different mediums and \u003Ca href=\"https://c2pa.org/\">efforts are already underway\u003C/a> with the support of some major players in technology. But the problem here lies in solidarity. There will always be companies refusing to opt in to standards because, either for technological or financial reasons, they can’t or don’t want to. And there will always be customers seeking these companies to get around those standards. And then we’re just back where we started trying to identify content generated by AI, though with at least a sizable amount of that work already done for us thanks to those standards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course another avenue that could offer relief from all this garbage would be through SEO changes. If search engines update their cryptic algorithms to favor human-generated content, or trusted sites that have shown reliability and authenticity, over AI-generated content in search results that would almost certainly provide a financial incentive for companies to clean things up. But in many cases these same tech companies that rule over SEO \u003Ca href=\"https://www.404media.co/google-news-is-boosting-garbage-ai-generated-articles/\">don’t have any incentive\u003C/a> to clean up an internet that they themselves are already actively polluting with AI-generated junk. And if the history of SEO changes is any indication, this effort will devolve into an endless and forth between search engines making new rules and SEO experts finding new ways to work around those same rules.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what does all of this mean for the future of our internet? To put it simply, I think the average internet experience is going to keep seeing a steady downturn in quality until suddenly that trend accelerates and we find ourselves neck-deep in AI-generated junk. And I’m worried that like any boiling frog (not that this idiom is true at all) by the time any of us notice it will be too late to take effective action.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My fear is that two versions of the internet will emerge because of this influx of garbage. One will be a well-maintained walled garden, full of mostly pleasant actual human people and an overall enjoyable place to visit with a nice barrier keeping out most but probably not all of the junk. And the other will be a true internet hellscape: inundated with low-quality content, spewing endlessly repetitive knockoffs of original thoughts at you, \u003Ca href=\"https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/\">reduced to stereotypes\u003C/a>, with fake people hawking nonsense goods &#x26; services and constant waves of spam ads knocking you down with every click. And the the only factor separating the two will be price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/The Great Internet Garbage Patch is Growing Larger Every Day/Inequality Divide.png\">\n  Meet your new internets! (Not to be on the nose or anything)\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>Content moderation costs companies a lot of time, money, and headache depending on who finds themselves being moderated. Which is why recently we’ve seen some shy away from moderation in favor of a free-for-all moderation ecosystem (to dubious results I might add). But other companies are finding little alternative but to ramp up content moderation efforts leading to rising costs that cut into revenue. And these two approaches may create a digital rift between the haves and the have-nots. We’ve already seen this to some extent with the recent influx of ad-free vs. ad-supported streaming options (proving that cost is once again the ultimate deciding factor as we saw with the “free” ad-supported TV so many people signed onto). If that happens there’s going to be an economic separation of tech companies that take necessary steps to prevent this influx of low-quality AI content and the ones that don’t. And my fear is that this will segregate the internet into two very distinct cultural experiences.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There isn’t a whole lot we as individual users can do to prevent this wave of garbage. I’ve seen some argue that the only way to effectively combat this invasion is through \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/opinion/ai-internet-x-youtube.html\">government intervention and legislation\u003C/a>, which I agree would be a massive step in the right direction. But this AI-generated content isn’t going anymore and the tools to make it are only going to become more accessible with each passing day. Like any tech trend we’ve seen take off in the past the AI hype train has a lot of momentum, but I do think society has started to recognize enough of its inherent problems that enthusiasm has begun to dampen. Our only hope is that enough outcry, both from users and all the tech companies in this space who are going to take the brunt of the damage this influx of garbage will cause, forces AI companies to invest in effective tools to moderate and manage the flow of this mess they’ve created. But for now we will have to wade our way through this trickle of garbage and junk in the search for authentic Denzel Washington content. Just don’t be surprised when that trickle turns into something bigger.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe class=\"embedded-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdT2ZATYuMQ?si=qZGaTDAppn_AOTfY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\u003Cp>There’s a Denzel reference for every occasion, including a metaphor for the invasion of\u003Cbr>\nAI-generated garbage content on the internet.\u003C/p>",{"headings":215,"localImagePaths":216,"remoteImagePaths":217,"frontmatter":218,"imagePaths":221},[],[],[],{"title":204,"description":205,"pubDate":219,"heroImage":207,"tags":220},"Jan 02 2025",[187],[],"the-united-states-finally-makes-the-tiktok-ban-a-thing",{"id":222,"data":224,"body":231,"filePath":232,"digest":233,"rendered":234},{"title":225,"description":226,"pubDate":227,"heroImage":228,"tags":229},"The United States Finally Makes the TikTok Ban A Thing","Looks like no one thought of the children (insert ticking clock puns here)",["Date","2024-04-04T06:00:00.000Z"],"/src/media/The United States Finally Makes the TikTok Ban A Thing/TikTokLogofeatured.png",[143,230],"policy","In a somewhat surprising turn of events, this week [the Senate passed](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137638/senate-passes-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-bytedance-foreign-aid) a foreign aid package [soon after signed into law](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package) by President Biden that includes a bill forcing parent company ByteDance to sell off TikTok or risk the app being banned in the US.\n\nWhile bills seeking to ban TikTok have existed in many forms over the past few years, this [RESTRICT Act](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23697944-restrict-act-final-text) was [first introduced](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686) in March 2023 and quickly managed to gain bipartisan support. Despite outcry from both [TikTok users](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/tiktok-continues-push-alert-campaign-00146343) and [free speech advocates](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-statement-on-congress-latest-attempt-to-ban-tiktok-and-restrict-free-speech-online), lawmaker's [national security concerns](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/restrict-act-bill-tiktok-rcna73682) came out on top and allowed the bill to make its way into a [foreign aid package](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/us/politics/aid-bill-ukraine-israel-taiwan.html) for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n\nWhile the bill provides the US Secretary of Commerce with more oversight and power to act against companies owned by \"foreign adversaries\" of the United States, it doesn't really address many of the privacy concerns that have been cited by lawmakers and which the same could be said of many US-controlled companies. A more effective option for addressing privacy concerns would probably be the The American Privacy Rights Act, a data privacy bill [introduced earlier this month](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/07/data-privacy-consumer-rights-bill-congress). So while hopefully that bill will be passed in the future, its contents will likely face much more domestic opposition from US-based tech companies. Regardless of other legislation and criticisms of the RESTRICT Act, what's certain is that ByteDance officially has nine months (potentially twelve if the next president extends that deadline) to figure out what to do.\n\nSo what is going to happen next? For proponents of this bill, probably not much in the immediate future. I feel fairly confident that everyone involved in passing this bill will be looking to avoid the subject as much as possible until after the 2024 presidential election. While the Democrats will likely get more of the blame than Republicans since the bill was signed by President Biden, I believe neither party has any desire to wade into these contentious waters. TikTok found massive popularity with US voters (though its recent [push into commercialization](https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-is-bad-boring-fyp-2024-2) has dampened that enthusiasm recently) and could potentially alienate candidates from potential voters. This will probably turn into a problem for whoever ends up in office.\n\nAs for ByteDance, they have been fairly adamant about [fighting the ban in court](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/tiktok-ban-bytedance-will-not-sell-app-1235983185/) on first amendment grounds. Whether that will be an effective strategy depends on whether [free speech concerns will be able to outweigh the government's national security concerns](https://www.platformer.news/tiktok-ban-bill-senate-legal-challenge-first-amendment/). It's hard to say at this point, though historically I think the US courts have tended to give our government very broad oversight when it comes to national security concerns (see: [The Patriot Act](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act#:~:text=Under%20the%20Patriot%20Act%2C%20National,to%20one%20terror%2Drelated%20conviction.)). And then in the court of public opinion I'm sure the company will do what it can to garner public support and put pressure on US lawmakers.\n\nBut overall I think most actors in this drama will be staying fairly quiet outside of the courtroom, except for possibly TikTok's users if they decide to make more noise about a potential ban. Until this court case plays out we will just have to wait and see what happens.

Now we've had scammers trying to build fake romantic relationships since before we even had cellphones. Preying on people's vulnerabilities is nothing new. But these scammers, at least from my experience, start by trying to establish a very simple and platonic rapport with their victims. Either just a simple hello, or something a little more complex to start an actual conversation with me. And you know what? It kind of worked, at least for a little while.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend/Text Scammer (Horseback Riding).png\">\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend/Text Scammer Conversation.png\">\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\nI actually responded to the first few of these messages before I caught on and disengaged. I meet my fair share of new people and I'm terrible at keeping track of names, numbers, or where I'm supposed to know someone from. So it's not outside the realm of possibilities that someone slipped through the cracks of my contact list. A few of these scammers received a very pleasant \"I'm so sorry I don't have this number, who is this?\" message from me. And just like that they were in! Not surprisingly a lot of them blew their chance immediately upon their second message, but a few persevered beyond that. I even had one apologize so profusely for accidentally texting me it felt like the digital equivalent of prostrating themselves before me out of shame. The plan was just plain silly, but I can definitely see how someone might be pulled into a conversation at the sight of a pitifully apologetic stranger who could use some reassurance. Of course after the first few I picked up on the play and stopped engaging. But a part me really enjoyed this conversational tactic despite knowing the endgame was to steal my money or identity or what have you. The idea was so simple and so much more humane, even kind of touching in the way it was based on real human connection. Like a scam-based version of Omegle ([RIP](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953620/omegle-anonymous-video-chat-shut-down-online-safety)), pairing me up with a stranger probably halfway around world. As an average person I found the whole experience kind of novel. I'd bet for the intended targets, the most vulnerable and lonely of us, this strategy may be pretty effective.\n\n\nI have a few theories why this new text-based scamming tactic has started to pick up in 2023. For one thing, it's pretty safe to say that the world is full of scared, sad, and depressed people right now. It's a safe bet that scammer are picking up on the social cues of the world around them. Not to mention we are all still recovering from the (arguably ongoing) pandemic that killed a lot of people and scarred plenty more. And secondly, the old tactics probably aren't as effective anymore. Every day the favored demographic scammers, our tech-adverse and innocent elderly, are being replaced by the tech-savvy. Not to say that there won't always be vulnerable elders, but I think it's fair to say that this pool is getting smaller somewhat. And then lastly, mobile companies have gotten much better at identifying and blocking scammers from their targets. It's an uphill battle that never ends, but most of us can see the current technology has gone a pretty good job of filtering out would-be scammers from even reaching our inbox. So I think scammers have had to adapt to these trying times by making their outreach more personal, more believable, and more individualized to sidestep all of these blockers.\n\nI tried to find any data to corroborate my theories, but it doesn't look like there is too much public-facing data specifically focused on SMS scams. However I did find [one article from our friends at the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/06/iykyk-top-text-scams-2022) listing the top text scams of 2022:\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; justify-content: center;\">\n\n1. Copycat bank fraud prevention alerts\n2. Bogus \"little gifts\" that can cost you\n3. Fake package delivery problems\n4. Phony job offers\n5. Not-really-from-Amazon security alerts\n\u003C/div>\n\nAnd then another survey from the Mobile Ecosystem Focum, which is apparently a global trade association, that displays their [top text scams of 2021](https://mobileecosystemforum.com/2022/02/18/top-five-text-message-scams-in-2021/):\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; justify-content: center;\">\n\n1. Covid-19 related scams\n2. Fake Insurance scams\n3. Fake package delivery problems\n4. Copycat bank fraud prevention alerts\n5. Cure-all health scams\n\u003C/div>\n\nIt's interesting to see the changes over just one year, but I'd be very interested to see which trends end up on top for 2023. Will these \"let's be friends\" messages make the list? The other questions I have is how will AI affect all of this? It seems to me that eventually someone will be using an AI to create scam messages like these at an extraordinarily large volume. Will our safeguards be able to keep up with a deluge like that? It's hard to say right now, but personally I'm a little worried at the thought.\n\nMost of this is based on anecdotal evidence, so I can't say for certain if this is a real trend or I'm just a lucky beta tester for this newly-emerging scam. But I've reached out to a few of these scam texts to see if I can spark some conversations with my new potential friends. Part of me fears that if the messages I responded to are all from the same scammer that I'll come off as desperate and they will go to ground. Only time will tell!\n\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend/Apologetic Text Scammer.png\">\u003C/div>","src/content/blog/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend.md","ca36969293248ddd",{"html":256,"metadata":257},"\u003Cp>I’ve had the same phone number my entire life, ever since I was gifted a thick brick of a Nokia cell phone the freshmen year of high school.

Either just a simple hello, or something a little more complex to start an actual conversation with me. And you know what? It kind of worked, at least for a little while.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend/Text Scammer (Horseback Riding).png\">\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/media/These Nigerian Princes Want to Be Your Friend/Text Scammer Conversation.png\">\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>I actually responded to the first few of these messages before I caught on and disengaged. I meet my fair share of new people and I’m terrible at keeping track of names, numbers, or where I’m supposed to know someone from. So it’s not outside the realm of possibilities that someone slipped through the cracks of my contact list. A few of these scammers received a very pleasant “I’m so sorry I don’t have this number, who is this?” message from me. And just like that they were in! Not surprisingly a lot of them blew their chance immediately upon their second message, but a few persevered beyond that. I even had one apologize so profusely for accidentally texting me it felt like the digital equivalent of prostrating themselves before me out of shame. The plan was just plain silly, but I can definitely see how someone might be pulled into a conversation at the sight of a pitifully apologetic stranger who could use some reassurance. Of course after the first few I picked up on the play and stopped engaging. But a part me really enjoyed this conversational tactic despite knowing the endgame was to steal my money or identity or what have you. The idea was so simple and so much more humane, even kind of touching in the way it was based on real human connection. Like a scam-based version of Omegle (\u003Ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953620/omegle-anonymous-video-chat-shut-down-online-safety\">RIP\u003C/a>), pairing me up with a stranger probably halfway around world. As an average person I found the whole experience kind of novel. I’d bet for the intended targets, the most vulnerable and lonely of us, this strategy may be pretty effective.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have a few theories why this new text-based scamming tactic has started to pick up in 2023. For one thing, it’s pretty safe to say that the world is full of scared, sad, and depressed people right now. It’s a safe bet that scammer are picking up on the social cues of the world around them. Not to mention we are all still recovering from the (arguably ongoing) pandemic that killed a lot of people and scarred plenty more. And secondly, the old tactics probably aren’t as effective anymore. Every day the favored demographic scammers, our tech-adverse and innocent elderly, are being replaced by the tech-savvy. Not to say that there won’t always be vulnerable elders, but I think it’s fair to say that this pool is getting smaller somewhat. And then lastly, mobile companies have gotten much better at identifying and blocking scammers from their targets. It’s an uphill battle that never ends, but most of us can see the current technology has gone a pretty good job of filtering out would-be scammers from even reaching our inbox. So I think scammers have had to adapt to these trying times by making their outreach more personal, more believable, and more individualized to sidestep all of these blockers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I tried to find any data to corroborate my theories, but it doesn’t look like there is too much public-facing data specifically focused on SMS scams. However I did find \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/06/iykyk-top-text-scams-2022\">one article from our friends at the FTC\u003C/a> listing the top text scams of 2022:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; justify-content: center;\">\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Copycat bank fraud prevention alerts\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bogus “little gifts” that can cost you\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Fake package delivery problems\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Phony job offers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Not-really-from-Amazon security alerts\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>And then another survey from the Mobile Ecosystem Focum, which is apparently a global trade association, that displays their \u003Ca href=\"https://mobileecosystemforum.com/2022/02/18/top-five-text-message-scams-in-2021/\">top text scams of 2021\u003C/a>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: grid; justify-content: center;\">\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Covid-19 related scams\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Fake Insurance scams\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Fake package delivery problems\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Copycat bank fraud prevention alerts\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Cure-all health scams\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp>It’s interesting to see the changes over just one year, but I’d be very interested to see which trends end up on top for 2023. Will these “let’s be friends” messages make the list? The other questions I have is how will AI affect all of this? It seems to me that eventually someone will be using an AI to create scam messages like these at an extraordinarily large volume. Will our safeguards be able to keep up with a deluge like that? It’s hard to say right now, but personally I’m a little worried at the thought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most of this is based on anecdotal evidence, so I can’t say for certain if this is a real trend or I’m just a lucky beta tester for this newly-emerging scam. But I’ve reached out to a few of these scam texts to see if I can spark some conversations with my new potential friends. Part of me fears that if the messages I responded to are all from the same scammer that I’ll come off as desperate and they will go to ground.
