But this new installation is what I suppose one could call top-of-the-line. Each spot is assigned a location number, you type your license plate into the kiosk, then pay and you were all set. You can even pay or add more time remotely, either on a website or through a newly connected parking app. Easy peasy!\n\nAt face value there is nothing wrong with updated technology. The kiosk still takes cash and coins, so we aren't looking at issues such as economic inequality or access like you see from businesses trending toward cashless operations. Likewise, the new interface is more efficient, legible, and fast than the old meters with their painfully slow card readers. But there was one (hopefully) unintended consequence that stood out to me from this newly introduced technology. This new parking meter system assigns payments based on license plate numbers instead of the traditional, perhaps old-fashioned, meter system where every spot had a meter and any payment was applied to that spot. So as soon as you drive away any leftover parking time leaves with you. It takes me maybe 15 minutes, tops, to walk to the bank and buy my quarter rolls. Usually I exit the neighborhood with more than ample time left in my one hour minimum. I can't share those leftovers anymore, provide a thankless and anonymous donation to whichever fellow human being happens to take over for my spot as I pull out.

And the response has been… overwhelming negative to say the least.\n\nThere are more than a few obvious reasons why these AI devices are being thoroughly panned by most reviewers. For starters, they are just plain bad. Both have had their fair shares of flaws right out of the gate: poor battery life, confusing if not completely ineffective interfaces, and perhaps most notable of all barely offering a fraction of the functionality that their companies have been proudly marketing in all the time leading up to these releases. Lately it seems overpromising and underdelivering has become the norm for far too many tech companies, Human and Rabbit Inc. chief among them. Instead of the wide assortment of integrations with third party software and everyday use cases, both companies are now saying that their biggest features are still “in development” or “on the roadmap” while consumers are left with buggy and disappointing bricks that can’t even set a timer or tell you the weather.\n\nWhat I’ll say about the state of both devices is that consumers can and should demand better from these companies. We’ve seen this same release planning play out in gaming to disastrous effect, and like other reviewers I’ll echo the fact that no one should be paying for these devices in their current state. Both Rabbit and Humane made grandiose claims about what these devices could do and almost none of that capability currently exists in either device. And probably won’t exist for a very long time, if ever. Dangling features like these to entice consumers is at best an underhanded gimmick that creates distrust and also hinders any future attempts to create worthwhile products in this new category. While a vocal minority have stirred controversy by attacking tech reviewers for not giving these companies a chance to iterate and improve their products, those wounds are entirely self-inflicted by making promises that couldn’t be kept.\n\nMany reviewers tried their best to at least acknowledge the few bright spots of both devices. For the Human AI Pin this was the fact that the device was trying something daring by removing your phone from the picture entirely, even if that didn’t really work at all and only further highlighted the effectiveness of the modern smartphone. Meanwhile the Rabbit R1 was mainly applauded for being positioned as more of a novelty device than a serious tool thanks to its cheaper price and sleek Teenage Engineering-supplied aesthetic, not that two hundred dollars is inexpensive (and it still remains to be seen if the device will eventually start charging a subscription). But with very little else to find, most reviewers were forced to fall back on what’s essentially become a trope by now when discussing AI; mentioning the exciting hypothetical potential of gadgets like these in the future, but a future that is very far off from where they are now.\n\nBut I think the biggest reason that gadgets like these won’t be adopted anytime soon comes down to a fundamental flaw of current AI technology that has existed since it first exploded in popularity and becomes even more glaring in the context of standalone AI devices: the lack of reliability.\n\nWe've moved on from the “Hey look at this cool new thing!” era of initial AI discourse and into the “Look at how AI will help regular Joes!” stage. AI companies face rising costs, slowing growth, and massive skepticism need to sell these tools however they can to an increasingly wary public which is also concerned about potentially losing their jobs to these same tools. But the tired answer of “AI can help with _xyz_ but only sometimes and there’s a pretty good chance it will be factually inaccurate or just lie to you fairly frequently” just isn’t good enough for the average consumer. Both the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 reviews have made it abundantly clear that you shouldn’t rely on them for anything important. Hallucination is rampant, whether you are asking for the weather, the score from last night’s game, or a summary of how nuclear fission works. It’s the same roulette wheel of chance whether or not what you receive from the device is accurate or even addresses your current need.\n\nThere’s an implicit trust we have in the devices we use every day and that trust has to be earned. But I still don’t know anyone who puts faith in AI at that level, or even trusts it at all for that matter. If anything this lack of reliability creates a necessity for paranoia that most find uncomfortable if not time-consuming and energy-draining to the point of uselessness. The inherent skepticism we have with AI in its current state makes using them as standalone devices impossible for the same reason why you wouldn’t want to be friends with someone who lied to you every third sentence. A relationship like that means your guard always has to be up to some extent and that is exhausting. You wouldn’t keep a smartphone in your pocket everyday if a call failed every third try, and until that changes no one is likely to keep either the Humane AI Pin or the Rabbit R1 in their pocket (or on their shirt collar) either.\n\n\n\u003Ch3 style=\"text-align: center\">Featured Image Review Links:\u003C/h3>\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;\">\n\u003Cdiv>\n- **Humane AI Pin**\n    - [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/the-humane-ai-pin-is-the-solution-to-none-of-technologys-problems-120002469.html)\n    - [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA)\n    - [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/11/humane-ai-pin-review/)\n    - [Wired](https://www.wired.com/review/humane-ai-pin/)\n    - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review)\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\n- **Rabbit R1**\n    - [Mashable](https://mashable.com/review/rabbit-r1)\n    - [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc)\n    - [Tom’s Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/rabbit-r1-review)\n    - [Techradar](https://www.techradar.com/phones/i-spent-a-day-with-rabbit-r1-and-its-a-beautiful-mess-that-im-not-sure-anyone-needs)\n    - [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147159/rabbit-r1-review-ai-gadget)\n\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>","src/ioriotblog/blog/Lousy Gadgets are Shining a Spotlight on AI's Biggest Problem.md","97895379fd8e6650",{"html":47,"metadata":48},"\u003Cp>With the long-anticipated release of the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 the first wave of standalone AI gadgets have arrived in consumer’s hands.

Not massively worse mind you, but enough to be noticeable here and there. A slightly downgraded experience affecting almost every corner of the internet.\n\nThis change became abundantly clear one day while scrolling through my TikTok feed. The app's massive push towards monetization has already turned most of my feed into a wasteland of QVC imitators, but amidst the depressing shopping livestreams and bizarre product placements I noticed a curious new trend; static images of Denzel Washington with motivational quotes narrated over the top.\n\nThe reason this caught my attention is because I'm already a big fan of Mr. Washington's work. I grew watching his films (_Fallen_ is a great movie and I will gladly die on that hill!) and I'm very familiar with the cadence of his voice and his more famous quotes. So it was immediately obvious to me that the audio of his voice was AI-generated and I was fairly certain Denzel Washington had never said this.\n\nThen not two videos later I was confronted with another, a different Denzel picture but the exact same quote and AI audio.

In fact it looks like this quote has only existed for a few months based on the timestamps I saw while combing through TikTok videos. But I don't believe seeing all these videos at once are just mere algorithmic happenstance.\n\nBesides this Denzel deluge I've seen similar patterns everywhere in my corner of the internet: social media feeds for every app have slightly more low-quality sponsored content and advertisements to scroll past. Friend requests from spam accounts sending phishing links or pornography are increasing in frequency. Search engine results have a little bit more junk we need to wade through to find the answers we need than they used to. Even more isolated areas of content don't seem to be immune to this onslaught (just ask the scientific community about their recent [dubious research results](https://www.404media.co/google-says-it-discovered-millions-of-new-materials-with-ai-human-researchers/) or [peer reviews](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07183.pdf)). The junk and spam seeping into the internet is steadily increasing in velocity and volume and as a result I find myself spending more of my time filtering through meaningless and worthless pieces of content. Or put more simply, the internet is filling up with garbage. And more than usual.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"img-section\">\n\u003Cimg src=\"/media/The Great Internet Garbage Patch is Growing Larger Every Day/Ocean Garbage.png\">\u003C/img>\nIt's like a For You page but with less reposts\n\u003C/div>\n\n\n\nIt seems one of the more negative consequences of AI advances has finally started to rear its head. Easier access to this technology has allowed more people than ever to [start churning out low-quality content at an exponential pace](https://www.404media.co/inside-the-world-of-tiktok-spammers-and-the-ai-tools-that-enable-them/) in the never-ending pursuit of consumers, whether that's in the form of views, clicks, or likes, and the potential income that can come along with them. Not to mention the rampant disinformation and misinformation we're seeing from this content that plenty of social media users [aren't even noticing](https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-being-overrun-with-stolen-ai-generated-images-that-people-think-are-real/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter). And this is just the start, wait until AI-generated content has really whittled away at the foundations of [world history](https://marinaamaral.substack.com/p/ai-is-creating-fake-historical-photos) and other . Many publications have already written about how AI going mainstream would affect the fields of SEO and marketing, but it seems this change has finally started to impact the public-facing side of the internet as well. And the bad news is that it's only going to get worse from here.\n\nThe problem is there doesn't seem to be much anyone can or will do to head off the tidal wave of internet garbage headed our way. While AI-generated content is all the rage, tools to identify and filter this content has seen very little enthusiasm. AI detection tools have proven ineffective at best (and usually [worse](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/07/1075982/ai-text-detection-tools-are-really-easy-to-fool/) or [much worse](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/) than that), when they aren't [being taken out of use entirely](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807487/openai-ai-generated-low-accuracy), and that arms race will always be reacting to advances rather than proactively cleaning up. A few areas of the internet have seen successful attempts to detect and filter out AI-generated content, but only targeted very specific fields of content or use cases. Typically this has been accomplished by looking at the content against a threshold for what most likely constitutes AI patterns compared to the average person’s use of language. But this is while AI-generated content can still be laughably obvious in many cases. Will these detection tools be effective at all once it becomes almost impossible to tell the difference between content created by humans and AI through language patterns? And who is going to decide where to draw a line between these two? Language is a complex and ever-changing landscape, so adding to this complexity is that any tool created will need to be able to keep up with these changes. On top of that, who knows what kind of changes in syntax and dialect we’ll see as a result AI’s influence over the next few years?\n\nOn the opposite end of this conundrum, AI signatures are another tool being created to easily differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated content. Establishing standards to mark AI content at the source seems to be a more effective solution given the sheer volume of content being generated in so many different mediums and [efforts are already underway](https://c2pa.org/) with the support of some major players in technology. But the problem here lies in solidarity. There will always be companies refusing to opt in to standards because, either for technological or financial reasons, they can't or don't want to. And there will always be customers seeking these companies to get around those standards. And then we’re just back where we started trying to identify content generated by AI, though with at least a sizable amount of that work already done for us thanks to those standards.\n\nOf course another avenue that could offer relief from all this garbage would be through SEO changes. If search engines update their cryptic algorithms to favor human-generated content, or trusted sites that have shown reliability and authenticity, over AI-generated content in search results that would almost certainly provide a financial incentive for companies to clean things up. But in many cases these same tech companies that rule over SEO [don't have any incentive](https://www.404media.co/google-news-is-boosting-garbage-ai-generated-articles/) to clean up an internet that they themselves are already actively polluting with AI-generated junk. And if the history of SEO changes is any indication, this effort will devolve into an endless and forth between search engines making new rules and SEO experts finding new ways to work around those same rules.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the future of our internet? To put it simply, I think the average internet experience is going to keep seeing a steady downturn in quality until suddenly that trend accelerates and we find ourselves neck-deep in AI-generated junk. And I’m worried that like any boiling frog (not that this idiom is true at all) by the time any of us notice it will be too late to take effective action.\n\nMy fear is that two versions of the internet will emerge because of this influx of garbage. One will be a well-maintained walled garden, full of mostly pleasant actual human people and an overall enjoyable place to visit with a nice barrier keeping out most but probably not all of the junk. And the other will be a true internet hellscape: inundated with low-quality content, spewing endlessly repetitive knockoffs of original thoughts at you, [reduced to stereotypes](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/), with fake people hawking nonsense goods & services and constant waves of spam ads knocking you down with every click.

Which is why recently we've seen some shy away from moderation in favor of a free-for-all moderation ecosystem (to dubious results I might add). But other companies are finding little alternative but to ramp up content moderation efforts leading to rising costs that cut into revenue.

But this AI-generated content isn’t going anymore and the tools to make it are only going to become more accessible with each passing day. Like any tech trend we’ve seen take off in the past the AI hype train has a lot of momentum, but I do think society has started to recognize enough of its inherent problems that enthusiasm has begun to dampen. Our only hope is that enough outcry, both from users and all the tech companies in this space who are going to take the brunt of the damage this influx of garbage will cause, forces AI companies to invest in effective tools to moderate and manage the flow of this mess they’ve created.
