<p>The reception for OpenAI’s new GPT-5 model was less than stellar by most accounts (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/759755/gpt-5-failed-the-hype-test-sam-altman-openai">1</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-5-backlash-sam-altman/">2</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/gpt-5-disaster">3</a>); everybody seemed to have one reason or another for disliking this new model, whether it was the disappearance of ChatGPT’s “personality” traits or just the model’s overall effectiveness.</p>
<p>So with all the hubbub surrounding this model’s release it’s easy to understand why OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uu_VJeVVfo">announcement of GPT-5</a> has been mostly forgotten. Yes the presentation felt a bit underwhelming and sure there were a couple of fairly egregious chart crimes being referred to as “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/756444/openai-gpt-5-vibe-graphing-chart-crime">vibe graphing,</a>” but why bother dwelling on such a tiny piece of the tech world? Yet here we are over a month later and I’m still thinking about that presentation, or more specifically OpenAI’s bar graph snafus within that presentation.</p>

  This Chart title is way too on the nose
</div>
<p>I feel conflicted about the whole thing: On the one hand, I can absolutely understand how these mistakes could’ve been the result of last-minute crunch. I’ve been there myself, rushing to get in a few last-minute changes to a slide deck or make one last graph only to realize mid-presentation that I left out a label or mistyped a number. But part of me also finds it hard to believe that a presentation from a company as big as OpenAI wouldn’t have passed through more than a few different hands before arriving at a final version. And the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist in me finds it a little too convenient that every chart error was to OpenAI’s benefit.</p>

  I mean come on, seriously?!

<p>I’m not saying all this to pick on OpenAI. These lousy bar graphs were only the latest in a long line of chart crimes that inspired this project’s inception. And let’s be honest, OpenAI barely had any egg on its face from the gaffe; Sam Altman owned up to the mistake, a few OpenAI employees admitted to the errors, and everyone was directed towards the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">announcement blog post</a> for accurate data visualizations that I’m sure everyone reviewed after the fact (note the slight sarcasm here). They’ll be just fine (maybe? <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/">depends on who you ask</a>).</p>
<p>This problem is so much bigger than one company. The digital age has brought with it an exponential increase in data sources and their availability to modern society; every day an untold number of data points are being logged, aggregated, analyzed, and visualized. With this explosion in quantitative data there has also been a surge in the misleading use of data and how it’s presented to a wider audience. On top of that, recent events have allowed this kind of unethical and misleading data visualization to become far more widespread, even acceptable in the eyes of certain<em>ahem</em> individuals and entities. Move fast and break things, true to form, is just as destructive and ineffective when applied to data. We’ve turned data visualization into present now and maybe apologize later if there’s enough pushback.</p>
<p>We can see it all over the place: enormous international companies, official government bodies, and influential individuals presenting shoddy data with little to no regard for sound data analysis or the impact of misleading their audiences. Data is being twisted, warped, and shifted every which way to match foregone conclusions.</p>
<p>Dubious Charts is a project about giggling at graphs, criticizing charts, and mocking misleading (if not outright false) data. I’m also hoping to unearth unethical data usage where I can and maybe showcase some egregious data stories throughout history. Call it truth to power, call it being persnickety, whatever this is I feel a need to talk about a problem that’s become all too common. Every report, chart, and graph that knowingly obscures reality or hides behind complexity to misleads its audience chips away at the truth. And every time we don’t push back against obfuscation we cede another step to the muddy waters of doubt and confusion.</p>
<p>Maybe even more important than speaking truth to power is not letting anyone lose sight of what we’re really talking about here. Behind the complex abstractions and fancy corporate visualizations is data that has a real impact on people’s lives whether we’re discussing stock prices, job numbers, healthcare statistics, technology analytics, or anything else. Forgetting the people in-between the numbers turns data science into a pointless exercise and I aim to remind us all of that.</p>  </div> </article> </main> <footer data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <div class="buttondown-subscribe-box" data-astro-cid-npolrwqj> <div class="subscribe-box-content" data-astro-cid-npolrwqj> <form class="subscribe-form" action="https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/ioriot" method="post" target="popupwindow" onSubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.com/ioriot', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form" data-astro-cid-npolrwqj> <input class="subscribe-email-input" type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" placeholder="Enter your email" data-astro-cid-npolrwqj> <input class="subscribe-submit-button" type="submit" value="Subscribe" data-astro-cid-npolrwqj> </form> </div> </div>  <div style="display: grid; justify-items: center;" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <p data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>© 2025 Designed & <a href="https://github.com/henry-boyd/tech-and-consequence" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Developed</a> by <a href="https://www.henry-boyd.com" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>Henry Boyd</a></p> </div> </footer>  </body></html>
